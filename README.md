# Web Automation Project - Price Comparison

### Objective: 
This project aimed to train the automation of web processes using Selenium to search for necessary information.

### How It Works:

In this project scenario, imagine working in the purchasing department of a company where constant supplier comparisons are necessary for inputs/products procurement.

The automation process involves:

- Searching the websites of various suppliers for available products and prices.
- Identifying products whose prices fall below predefined maximums.
- Updating this information in a spreadsheet.
- Sending an email notification with a list of products below the maximum purchase price.

Although the focus was on common products from websites like Google Shopping and Buscapé, the automation principles apply to other sites as well.

### What Was Achieved:

- Utilized Selenium for web automation.
- Successfully searched for products on Google Shopping and Buscapé.
- Retrieved and processed product prices within specified ranges.
- Updated a spreadsheet with relevant product information.
- Sent email notifications with product lists below maximum purchase prices.

### Conclusion:

With the completion of this project, the automation of price comparison tasks in web environments has been achieved. This allows for efficient supplier comparisons and timely decision-making in the purchasing process.
